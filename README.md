<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The bachelor project of Raynaud Cornille and Marthe Spriet is about a thesis topic tool. Each University has a similar tool where students can choose their top X favorite thesis topics. In this tool extern companies, university bound researchgroups or even students can add a thesis topic. These will be approved by thesis Coordinator of the same target audience (depends on a campus and a course). By implementing phases, not every functionality is always possible. There are in total 7 phases. 
* Submit topics
* Preferences students (choose top X)
* Preferences promotors (each topic has a promotor + the promotor can boost a student per topic if the student placed the topic as their first choice)
* Assignment topic to student (by algoritm or manual can topics be assigned to students)

The next 3 phases are duplicates of the last three phases except that these are located in september, after the examinations of august. And not between january to may.

Visitors of this website can log in as a student/company/researchgroup/thesiscoordinator/promotor or admin.
